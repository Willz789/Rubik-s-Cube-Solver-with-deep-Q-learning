# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver-with-deep-Q-learning

As we cannot upload a model of the neural network to Github, as the file would exceed the file size limit on Github of 25 mb, this version of the program is without a pre-made model, but it is currently set to train a model to work with a scramble complexity of 1.

To start the program, simply run main.py.
